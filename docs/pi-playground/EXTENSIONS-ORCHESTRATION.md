# Orchestration Extensions (playground)

Playground-only: [`extensions/`](../../extensions/), [`.pi/agents/`](../../.pi/agents/), [`.pi/damage-control-rules.yaml`](../../.pi/damage-control-rules.yaml). Not the Ink control plane (`src/`).

| Extension | Feature | npm | just |
|-----------|---------|-----|------|
| agent-team | YAML teams + `dispatch_agent` dispatcher | `npm run pi-play:agent-team` | `just ext-agent-team` |
| system-select | `/system` persona picker | `npm run pi-play:system-select` | `just ext-system-select` |
| damage-control | Tool intercept + rules | `npm run pi-play:damage-control` | `just ext-damage-control` |
| agent-chain | Sequential pipeline | `npm run pi-play:agent-chain` | `just ext-agent-chain` |
| guarded-team | damage-control + agent-team combined | `npm run pi-play:guarded-team` | `just ext-guarded-team` |
| disciplined-subagent | TillDone + subagent-widget combined | `npm run pi-play:disciplined-subagent` | `just ext-disciplined-subagent` |

Automated config + policy smoke (no TUI): **`npm run verify:orchestration`**

Raw `pi` examples:

```bash

## agent-team

**What it is:** The primary session has no repo tools; it delegates work to specialists via the `dispatch_agent` tool. Specialists are Markdown personas under [`.pi/agents/*.md`](../../.pi/agents/). Teams are declared in [`.pi/agents/teams.yaml`](../../.pi/agents/teams.yaml).

**Team config**

- **`default`** — lean triad: `planner`, `builder`, `reviewer` (intended as the usual boot default; first key in YAML drives dialog order together with other teams).
- **`full`** — alternate wide roster: `scout`, `planner`, `builder`, `reviewer`, `documenter`, `red-team`.
- Other sets (`plan-build`, `frontend`, `pi-pi`, …) remain available for switching.

**Switch teams**

- At session start, a select dialog appears when multiple teams are defined; repos with only one team activate it silently.
- During the session: command **`/agents-team`** — choose another team from the same YAML.
- **`/agents-list`** — roster; **`/agents-grid N`** — dashboard columns.

**Manual proof**

1. `npm run pi-play:agent-team` (keys in env).
2. Pick `default` or `full` when prompted.
3. Ask the lead to delegate a trivial task to `reviewer` (or another member) via `dispatch_agent`.
4. Confirm the child session runs and the grid updates.

## system-select

**What it is:** **`/system`** opens a picker loaded from `.pi/agents/`, `.claude/agents`, `.gemini/agents`, `.codex/agents` (project + home, see [extensions/system-select.ts](../../extensions/system-select.ts)). Selected persona **prepends** body text to the system prompt; optional `tools:` in frontmatter narrows tools.

**Browser-like / specialized option**

- **[`.pi/agents/bowser.md`](../../.pi/agents/bowser.md)** — Playwright / headless browser agent (`name: bowser`). After launch, run **`/system`** and choose **bowser**.

**Manual proof**

1. `npm run pi-play:system-select`.
2. Run `/system` → **bowser** (or **scout**, **planner**, …).
3. Send a message; status line shows `System Prompt: …`.

---

## damage-control

**What it is:** Extension hooks **`tool_call`** and blocks or confirms risky operations using [`.pi/damage-control-rules.yaml`](../../.pi/damage-control-rules.yaml) (or `~/.pi/damage-control-rules.yaml` if project file missing).

**Rule categories**

- **`bashToolPatterns`** — regex on bash command; optional **`ask: true`** → confirm dialog instead of hard block; optional **`dryRun: true`** → log match without blocking.
- **`zeroAccessPaths`** — read/write/grep paths denied.
- **`readOnlyPaths`** — writes/edits denied.
- **`noDeletePaths`** — deletes denied.

**Global dry-run mode:** Add `dryRun: true` at the top level of the YAML to run all rules in observe-only mode — violations are logged but not blocked. Remove or set false to enforce.

**Audit log:** Every block/ask/dry-run decision is appended to `.pi/logs/damage-control-<timestamp>.jsonl` (one file per session, created automatically). Fields: `ts`, `sessionId`, `tool`, `input`, `rule`, `action`.

**Customize:** Edit the YAML; reload by restarting Pi with the extension.

**Manual proof (blocked command)**

1. `npm run pi-play:damage-control`.
2. In the Pi session, trigger a **bash** tool with: `git reset --hard` (or `rm -rf /tmp/foo` style matching rules).
3. Expect block notification and tool abort (wording from [extensions/damage-control.ts](../../extensions/damage-control.ts)).

**Automated:** `npm run verify:orchestration` asserts a non–`ask` pattern blocks `git reset --hard`.

## agent-chain

**What it is:** Chains live in [`.pi/agents/agent-chain.yaml`](../../.pi/agents/agent-chain.yaml). The primary agent uses the **`run_chain`** tool. Steps run **in order**; each step's model output becomes `$INPUT` for the next; `$ORIGINAL` is always the user's first message.

**Runnable example: `full-review`**

1. `scout` — explore / analyze
2. `planner` — plan from prior output
3. `builder` — implement
4. `reviewer` — review

**Switch chains**

- At session start, a select dialog appears when multiple chains are defined; single-chain repos activate silently.
- **`/chain`** — pick another during the session; **`/chain-list`** — names and step counts.

**Manual proof**

1. `npm run pi-play:agent-chain`.
2. Select **`full-review`** when prompted.
3. Ask for a small change (e.g. "add a comment in README"); approve **`run_chain`** when the model proposes it.
4. Watch step widgets advance through scout → planner → builder → reviewer.

## guarded-team (damage-control + agent-team)

**What it is:** The realistic production pattern. `damage-control.ts` loads first and intercepts every tool call; `agent-team.ts` then runs the dispatcher model. All `dispatch_agent` invocations and any rule violations are written to the session audit log at `.pi/logs/damage-control-<ts>.jsonl`.

**Usage:**
```bash
npm run pi-play:guarded-team
# or
just ext-guarded-team
```

**Key difference from agent-team alone:** specialist agents can still run unrestricted tool calls internally — damage-control only audits the primary session. For full cross-session enforcement, load damage-control in the specialist agent definitions too.

---

## disciplined-subagent (TillDone + subagent-widget)

**What it is:** `tilldone.ts` enforces task declaration before any tools run; `subagent-widget.ts` lets the primary agent delegate work to background Pi sessions via `/sub`. The parent must define at least one `tilldone` task before it can `/sub` anything out. Useful for showing structured async delegation with per-session context.

**Usage:**
```bash
npm run pi-play:disciplined-subagent
# or
just ext-disciplined-subagent
```

**Note on extension order:** `tilldone.ts` is loaded before `subagent-widget.ts` so that task discipline blocks apply before the sub command is available.

---

## When to use agent-chain vs agent-team

`agent-chain` is for **linear, repeatable pipelines** — the same steps in the same order every time. It is simple to configure (YAML steps) and has low orchestration overhead.

`agent-team` is for **adaptive, open-ended work** — the dispatcher decides which specialist to call based on the user's request. Use it when the workflow is not predetermined or when parallel delegation is needed.

**Conditional branching is not supported natively in agent-chain.** If a chain step needs to skip, branch, or loop based on prior output, that logic must be either baked into the step's prompt template (`$INPUT` inspection) or the task should be moved to an `agent-team` flow where the dispatcher can route dynamically.

---

## Limits

- **agent-team / agent-chain / guarded-team / disciplined-subagent** spawn real Pi child processes; need API keys and a real terminal for full proof.
- **`verify:orchestration`** checks YAML structure and damage-control regex only—not live TUI or `dispatch_agent` RPC.
- **damage-control** in guarded-team audits the primary session only; child sessions spawned by `dispatch_agent` run with their own tool permissions unless they also load damage-control.
