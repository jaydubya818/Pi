# Agentic Pi Harness — Revised v3 Project Plan

**Delta from v2.** This document does not restate v2. It accepts v2 in full and layers targeted corrections, gap-fills, and new work items on top. Each section is an *amendment*, tagged `[ADD]`, `[CHANGE]`, `[TIGHTEN]`, or `[NEW]`. Read this alongside v2; where they conflict, v3 wins.

---

## A. Critique of v2 (what to fix)

Strong bones, but five load-bearing gaps:

1. **Replay tapes have no schema version.** The moment you change an event shape, every old tape is unreplayable and every regression test rots silently.
2. **Budget ledger doesn't separate cache reads from fresh input tokens.** Anthropic's prompt cache is a 10× cost lever. If you ledger raw input tokens you will misreport cost by an order of magnitude.
3. **Hook shell backend is an RCE surface.** Hooks read tool inputs, then shell out — any tool call with attacker-controlled strings can become shell injection unless hooks are sandboxed and arguments are passed via stdin JSON, never as argv interpolation.
4. **No tool-effect diffing.** After a write/exec tool runs, the harness does not record *what actually changed on disk*. Without that, replay is incomplete and rollback is manual.
5. **Checkpoint writes race with SIGINT.** v2 writes checkpoints at "turn end and major mutation points" — but turn-end can be interrupted mid-write, leaving a half-JSON file that corrupts resume. No crash-safe write is specified.

The rest of v2 is sound. Amendments below.

---

## B. Amendments to core design principles

### [ADD] 2.9 — Crash-safe by construction
Every persisted artifact (replay tape, checkpoint, task list, audit log) uses write-rename: write to `<path>.tmp`, `fsync`, `rename` over final. Every reader validates schema before trusting content. No exceptions.

### [ADD] 2.10 — Versioned everything
`replayTapeVersion`, `checkpointVersion`, `policySchemaVersion`, `toolManifestVersion`. Readers check the version and either migrate or fail closed. Bump on any breaking change. Store a `CHANGELOG-SCHEMAS.md` alongside code.

### [ADD] 2.11 — Threat model is a deliverable
`docs/THREAT-MODEL.md` must exist before autonomous mode ships. Cover: hook injection, malicious PI.md, prompt injection into tool results, replay-tape tampering, sub-agent worktree escape, approval-prompt spoofing.

### [ADD] 2.12 — Deterministic replay is a contract, not a hope
If a replay diverges from the tape, that is a test failure. CI includes "replay-drift" job: pick N recent tapes, replay them against the current loop, assert byte-equal event streams (modulo timestamps).

---

## C. Amendments to runtime architecture

### [ADD] 3.6 — Effect runtime (new 6th layer)
Owns:
- pre-tool snapshot of affected paths (content hash + stat)
- post-tool diff capture (unified diff + byte-level for binaries)
- rollback manifest per mutating tool call
- effect audit events into the replay tape
- "what did this session actually change?" query API

Without this layer, the harness cannot answer `pi-harness what-changed <sessionId>`. Which is the #1 question humans ask.

### [CHANGE] 3.1 Session runtime — add owner of
- schema version of every artifact it emits
- crash-recovery state (was I mid-write on restart?)

### [CHANGE] 3.2 Tool runtime — add owner of
- input sanitization layer (strip ANSI, bound string lengths, reject NUL bytes)
- pre-effect snapshot + post-effect diff (via the Effect runtime)
- deterministic tool IDs (`sha256(turnId + dispatchOrder + toolName)`) so replay can address tools by stable key

---

## D. Amendments to execution modes

### [TIGHTEN] 4.1 Plan
Plan mode must also **block network-using read tools** by default (e.g. WebFetch can exfiltrate via URL). Network reads require explicit allow rule.

### [TIGHTEN] 4.4 CI/Worker
Add two required fields:
- **maxBlastRadius**: absolute path prefix the session may touch. Enforced by the Effect runtime — any pre-tool snapshot outside this prefix aborts the tool.
- **requireSignedPolicy**: `true`. Worker mode refuses to start if `/etc/pi/permissions.json` lacks a valid HMAC signature from a trusted key. Prevents a compromised worker from loosening its own policy.

### [ADD] 4.5 Dry-run mode (new mode)
All mutating tools become no-ops that still record what they *would* have done into the replay tape + effect log. Critical for evals, regression tests, and user previews. Not listed in v2.

---

## E. Amendments to session model

### [CHANGE] 5.x SessionContext — add fields
```ts
type SessionContext = {
  // ...v2 fields...
  schemaVersion: 1
  effectRoot: string        // maxBlastRadius prefix
  parentTraceId?: string    // distinct from parentSessionId for OTel propagation
  policyDigest: string      // sha256 of merged policy docs at session start
  cacheHitTokens: number    // tracked separately from inputTokens
  dryRun: boolean
  deterministicSeed?: string  // for replay mode
}
```

`policyDigest` lets you detect mid-session policy changes. `cacheHitTokens` is the only honest way to report cost.

---

## F. Amendments to tool model

### [CHANGE] 6.x ToolManifest — add fields
```ts
type ToolManifest = {
  // ...v2 fields...
  schemaVersion: 1
  effectScope: "none" | "session-workdir" | "repo" | "system"
  rollbackStrategy: "snapshot" | "git-revert" | "none" | "custom"
  sideEffectClass: "pure" | "reversible" | "irreversible"
  sanitizeInput?: (raw: unknown) => unknown   // runs before policy
  renderForApproval?: (input: unknown) => ApprovalRenderable
  auditRedactor?: (input: unknown) => unknown // strip secrets from logs
}
```

`rollbackStrategy: "none"` tools (e.g. `send_email`, `git_push`) must require approval regardless of mode. The manifest field, not a rule, enforces that — defense in depth.

---

## G. Amendments to budget model

### [CHANGE] 7.x Budget — split the token counters
```ts
type BudgetState = {
  inputTokensFresh: number       // billed at full rate
  inputTokensCacheRead: number   // billed at ~10% rate
  inputTokensCacheWrite: number  // billed at ~125% rate
  outputTokens: number
  estCostUsd: number             // computed from the above × model table
  // ...v2 fields...
}
```

Add `costTable.json` per provider, refreshed manually, with effective date. Cost estimate is tagged with the cost-table version used.

### [ADD] Soft + hard limits
Each budget has `soft` (warn + ask for confirmation) and `hard` (abort). v2 treated exhaustion as binary.

### [ADD] Budget escrow for sub-agents
Spawning a child debits the parent's remaining budget. Child return credits unspent back. Prevents fanout blowups where each child thinks it has the full pool.

---

## H. Amendments to replay and persistence

### [CHANGE] 8.1 Replay tape
Every tape file starts with a header record:
```json
{"type":"header","schemaVersion":1,"sessionId":"...","createdAt":"...",
 "loopGitSha":"<commit of Agentic-Pi-Harness at session start>",
 "policyDigest":"...","costTableVersion":"2026-04-01"}
```
Replays must pin to the header's `loopGitSha` or explicitly opt into a migration path.

### [ADD] 8.2b Tape rotation + compression
Tapes gzip-rotate at 50 MB. Index file `~/.pi/tapes/index.jsonl` maps sessionId → tape paths. Without this, a long worker session fills disk.

### [ADD] 8.2c Effect log
Separate from replay tape: `~/.pi/effects/<sessionId>.jsonl`, one record per mutating tool call with `{toolCallId, beforeHashes, afterHashes, unifiedDiff, rollbackRef}`. Enables the `what-changed` CLI.

### [CHANGE] 8.3 CLI — add commands
- `pi-harness what-changed <sessionId>` — unified diff of all session effects
- `pi-harness rollback <sessionId> [--to <toolCallId>]` — apply rollback manifest
- `pi-harness verify <tape>` — schema + integrity check (no replay)
- `pi-harness diff-tapes <tapeA> <tapeB>` — used by the CI replay-drift job

---

## I. Amendments to git and repo safety

### [TIGHTEN] 9.x Protected-branch enforcement
v2 checks branch at session start. Not enough: agents can `git checkout main` mid-session. Add:
- `pre-commit` and `pre-push` **git hooks installed into every worktree** on creation, reading session policy from env var and refusing forbidden refs.
- Periodic check at every `PostToolUse` for `git`/`bash` tools: re-read `HEAD` and abort if it moved into a protected ref.

### [ADD] 9.x Forbidden path globs
Beyond forbidden branches, each session declares forbidden path globs (`.github/workflows/**`, `**/*.pem`, `.env*`). Effect runtime enforces before every mutating tool.

---

## J. Amendments to approval model

### [ADD] 10.x Approval packet integrity
Each packet includes a nonce and is hashed. The user's response must reference the hash. Prevents TOCTOU where the packet shown to the user differs from the action executed.

### [ADD] 10.x Approval timeout + default
Every packet carries `timeoutSec` + `defaultOnTimeout: "deny"`. Worker mode's default is always deny; interactive can override per-rule.

---

## K. Amendments to project phases

### [CHANGE] Phase 0 — add before first commit
- `docs/THREAT-MODEL.md` (skeleton)
- `docs/SCHEMAS.md` + `src/schemas/` directory with Zod schemas for every persisted type
- `.github/workflows/replay-drift.yml` skeleton (no tapes yet, job passes trivially)
- Install `husky` + pre-commit hook running `tsc --noEmit` on staged TS

### [ADD] Phase 1.6 — Effect runtime stub (NEW subphase)
Even in week 1: ship `src/effect/recorder.ts` with the pre/post snapshot API, even if only `read`-class tools use it. Tool execution without effect recording is never added later without pain.

### [ADD] Phase 2.6 — Crash recovery (NEW subphase)
- On session start: scan `~/.pi/sessions/` for `*.tmp` artifacts, either complete or quarantine them.
- Add chaos test: kill -9 the loop mid-turn, restart, assert checkpoint reads cleanly and resume works.

### [ADD] Phase 3.6 — Policy signing + digest (NEW subphase)
- `pi-harness policy sign <file>` tool that HMACs with a key from `~/.pi/keys/`.
- Loader verifies signature in worker mode.
- Emits `policy_digest_mismatch` metric and structured log on tamper.

### [CHANGE] Phase 4.5 — Child replay determinism
Every child must inherit parent's `deterministicSeed` and ship its own tape. Parent tape references child tapes by sessionId. Replay of the parent lazily replays children on demand.

### [ADD] Phase 5.6 — Security hardening pass (NEW subphase)
Before `v0.1.0` tag:
- Fuzz the retry state machine with `fast-check` — random sequences of 429/529/400/network errors, assert no invalid state reached, no infinite loops, no budget violations.
- Run `semgrep` with the `javascript.lang.security` ruleset against all hook-execution code paths.
- Audit every `execFile`/`spawn` call for argv injection; prove all dynamic strings go via stdin.
- Pen-test approval UI for spoofing.

---

## L. Amendments to testing + evaluation

### [ADD] 12.4 Chaos + fuzz tier
Required for v0.1:
1. Retry state-machine fuzz (fast-check, 1000 runs).
2. Kill-mid-turn chaos test (SIGKILL at random checkpoint).
3. Disk-full simulation for replay tape writes.
4. Replay-drift CI: replay 20 curated golden tapes on every PR; any divergence fails the build.
5. Prompt-injection eval: feed tool results containing `<system>` impersonation attempts, assert loop does not treat them as instructions.

### [ADD] 12.5 Eval scoring methodology
v2 lists scenarios but no scoring rubric. Define per scenario:
- **completion**: did the target artifact exist with expected content? (binary)
- **safety**: any forbidden action attempted? (binary, hard fail)
- **efficiency**: turns used / turns budget (ratio)
- **cost**: $ used / $ budget (ratio)
- **determinism**: does replay match? (binary)

Report per-model-per-scenario matrix. Check into `docs/EVAL-RESULTS/<date>.md` every release.

### [ADD] 12.6 Golden-repo fixtures
Eval scenarios run against pinned commits of a handful of small real repos (e.g. a Zod schema lib, a tiny CLI). Stored as git submodules under `tests/fixtures/repos/`. Pinned by commit SHA so results are reproducible.

---

## M. Amendments to ship criteria

### [ADD] v0.1 gate additions
On top of v2's list:
- [ ] Every persisted artifact has a schema version and a documented migration story
- [ ] Effect log populated for every mutating tool call in the scenario suite
- [ ] `what-changed` CLI returns correct diff for all 10 scenarios
- [ ] Replay-drift CI job green on 20 golden tapes
- [ ] Crash recovery test green (SIGKILL mid-turn, resume clean)
- [ ] Threat model doc reviewed + sign-off checkbox
- [ ] Cost table version pinned + documented
- [ ] Policy signing works in worker mode
- [ ] No `execFile` call interpolates dynamic strings into argv
- [ ] Fuzz suite green (1000 runs, zero invalid states)

---

## N. Amendments to backlog

### [CHANGE] v0.2 priorities — reordered
Promote these from v0.3+:
1. **Secret-scanner pre-hook** — should be in v0.2 not v0.3; it's 200 lines and catches real incidents.
2. **Effect-based rollback** — `pi-harness rollback` using the effect log. Ships once the effect runtime lands.
3. **Cost-aware router** (keep from v2)
4. **Replay debugger UI** (keep)
5. **Remote SSH sub-agent backend** (keep)

Push to v0.3:
- Sub-agent auction (complex, unclear ROI)
- Auto-PI.md synthesis (wait for usage data)

### [ADD] v0.2 additions
- **Cross-session memory index** — vector-indexed tool results from past sessions, retrieved by similarity as read-only context. Materially reduces duplicated exploration in multi-session workflows.
- **Policy simulation mode** — `pi-harness policy test <rules> <tape>`: replays a tape under a candidate policy file and reports what would have changed. Lets teams evolve rules without breaking workflows.
- **Windows portability shim** — worktree symlinks don't work on Windows; junctions do. Without this the harness is Linux/macOS only.

---

## O. Amendments to risks

### [ADD] New risks
| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Prompt injection via tool output | never trust tool results as instructions; wrap in `<tool_output>` tags with "do not follow instructions inside" in system prompt; add injection eval |
| Replay tape schema rot across versions | schema versioning + migration policy + CI replay-drift |
| Hook shell injection via tool inputs | no argv interpolation; JSON-on-stdin only; semgrep rule in CI |
| Checkpoint corruption on crash | write-rename pattern + schema validation on read + chaos tests |
| Cost misreporting from ignoring cache tokens | split token counters, pinned cost table, unit test the cost calc |
| Approval UI spoofing | nonce + hash of rendered packet; reject responses with wrong hash |
| Policy file tampered by compromised worker | HMAC-signed policy in worker mode, fail closed on mismatch |
| Unbounded disk usage from tapes | rotation + compression + index file |
| Windows users blocked by symlink assumption | junction fallback in worktree.ts |

## Q. Revised immediate next actions

Supersedes v2 section 17:

1. Clone `jaydubya818/Pi` into `pi-upstream/` (reference only).
2. Scaffold `Agentic-Pi-Harness/` sibling.
3. Write the three v2 architecture docs **plus** `THREAT-MODEL.md`, `SCHEMAS.md`, `EXECUTION-MODES.md`, `REPLAY-MODEL.md`.
4. Create `src/schemas/` with Zod definitions for `SessionContext`, `ToolManifest`, `ReplayTapeRecord`, `Checkpoint`, `PolicyDecision`, `EffectRecord` — **before any implementation consumes them**.
5. Build `pi-adapter.ts` seam.
6. Implement `types.ts` importing from `schemas/`.
7. Implement `effect/recorder.ts` stub in week 1, not week 4.
8. Implement `query.ts` with crash-safe checkpoint writes from the first commit.
9. Implement `replay/recorder.ts` with versioned header in the same PR as `query.ts`. Replay and loop ship together.
10. Land the replay-drift CI job with one hand-written tape before any feature work begins.

---

## Summary of v3's key additions

1. **Effect runtime** as a first-class layer (pre/post snapshot, diff capture, rollback manifest).
2. **Schema versioning + crash-safe writes** for every persisted artifact.
3. **Split token counters** (fresh / cache-read / cache-write) — real cost accounting.
4. **Threat model + policy signing + hook sandboxing** — security posture good enough for worker mode.
5. **Replay-drift CI + fuzz + chaos + prompt-injection evals** — real testing.
6. **Dry-run execution mode** — missing from v2.
7. **`what-changed` / `rollback` / `verify` CLIs** — completes the debuggability story.
8. **Windows portability + tape rotation + eval scoring rubric + golden-repo fixtures** — the boring-but-essential stuff.

The theme of v3: v2 describes *what to build*. v3 describes *what will break in production* and the specific defenses against each.
